These Terms &amp; Conditions and the Master Subscriber Agreement constitute the entire agreement with respect to Time Warner Cable's bill payment service and transactions conducted through the service and, together, supersede all prior oral or written agreements with respect to the matters covered in the following Terms &amp; Conditions.

Part A - General
1. Definitions
As used in these Terms &amp; Conditions, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
"Business Day" means Monday through Friday, excluding Federal Reserve holidays and Time Warner Cable holidays.
"Cutoff Time" means 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time or another time as specified by your local Time Warner Cable office on any Business Day and is the time by which you must transmit Payment Instructions to have them considered entered in the Service on that particular Business Day.
"Including" or "Include" means inclusion, without limitation.
"Password" means any password, personal identification number and/or code issued to you by Time Warner Cable that must be used by you in order to gain access to the Service.
"Payment" means any bill payment to Time Warner Cable.
"Payment Account" means the financial institution account linked to the debit card from which your Payments will be made.
"Payment Instructions" means the method of payment information (such as credit card or debit card number and expiration date) entered in the Service to authorize a Payment.

"We", "us" or "our" means Time Warner Cable.

2. Bill Payment Service
(a) When initiating or authorizing a Payment through the Service, you authorize Time Warner Cable to process such Payment in accordance with your Payment Instructions, and you acknowledge and agree that the payment information you enter automatically will be saved within Time Warner Cable’s billing systems.  Payment Instructions entered after the Cutoff Time or on non-Business Days will be considered entered in the Service on the next Business Day.
(b) Your Time Warner Cable account balance will be credited to reflect the amount of any Payment authorized by you through the Service after Time Warner Cable has initiated the processing of such Payment. Such credit is provisional and is subject to Time Warner Cable's final receipt of good funds. Your Time Warner Cable account balance will generally be updated to reflect this credit within three Business Days of the date on which Time Warner Cable initiates the processing of your Payment. Time Warner Cable will reverse any such credit to your Time Warner Cable account and may assess any then applicable fees or charges, including late fees or fees for non-sufficient funds, if your Payment is returned for non-sufficient funds or otherwise cannot be processed or is later charged back or reversed.

(b) As a condition of your use of the Service, you will not use the Service for any purpose that is not authorized by these Terms &amp; Conditions. You may not interfere with any other party's use of the Service. You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service through any means.

Time Warner Cable is not responsible for your failure to receive any notices or information, or any other problem that results from your failure to keep such payment information current and accurate. You can update this information within the Service application or by calling Time Warner Cable It may take one billing cycle for your Payments to be processed in accordance with the changed information that you have provided to Time Warner Cable and, in the meantime, you will be solely responsible for taking all appropriate actions to ensure that your Time Warner Cable bill statements are paid when due.

Part B - Electronic Fund Transfer Disclosures
The following provisions apply to any consumer debit card Payment initiated or authorized through the Service.

1. Your Liability
Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your Password has been lost or stolen. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your Payment Account (plus your maximum overdraft line of credit). If you tell us within four (4) Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Password, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Password without your permission.
If you do NOT tell us within four (4) Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Password, and we can prove that we could have stopped someone from using your Password without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.
Also, if your statement from your financial institution regarding your Payment Account shows Payments through the Service that you did not authorize, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within ninety (90) days after the statement was sent to you, you may not get back any money transferred through the Service without your authorization after the ninety (90) days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.
If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.
If you believe your Password has been lost or stolen or that someone has transferred or may transfer money through the Service from your Payment Account without your permission, call Time Warner Cable or notify Time Warner Cable in writing, based on the contact information for your local Time Warner Cable office which may be located at  <a target="_blank" href="http://twc.com/stores">http://twc.com/stores</a>

2. Transfer Types and Limitations
You may use the Service to make Payments to Time Warner Cable only.  Each Payment made to Time Warner Cable through the Service must be in a minimum dollar amount of $1.00and cannot exceed $100.000.00.

3. Charges
We will not charge you a fee to make electronic fund transfers through the Service.

4. Confidentiality
We will disclose information to third parties about your Payment Account or the electronic fund transfers you make through the Service only as permitted by our privacy policy set forth at: <a target="_blank" href="http://help.twcable.com/html/policies.html">http://help.twcable.com/html/policies.html</a>.

5. Our Liability
If we do not complete a transfer through the Service from your Payment Account on time or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:

If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your Payment Account to make the transfer or your Payment Account does not otherwise permit the transaction to be executed.
If the transfer would go over the credit limit on your overdraft line.
If the Service was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer.
If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transfer, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.
There may be other exceptions stated in the Master Subscriber Agreement.
6. Errors and Questions
In case of errors or questions about your electronic fund transfers made through the Service, telephone us, write us or chat with us based on the contact information for your local Time Warner Cable office which may be located at <a target="_blank" href="http://twc.com/stores">http://twc.com/stores</a> as soon as you can, if you think that the statement regarding your Payment Account from your financial institution ("Periodic Statement") is wrong with respect to any Payment made through the Service or if you need more information about a transfer made through the Service that is listed on the Periodic Statement. We must hear from you no later than ninety (90) days after you received the FIRST Periodic Statement on which the problem or error appeared:

(a) Tell us your name and Time Warner Cable account number;
(b) Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information; and
(c) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.

If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within ten (10) Business Days.

Part B - Electronic Fund Transfer Disclosures
The following provisions apply to any consumer bank account payment initiated or authorized through the Service.

1. Your Liability
Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your Password has been lost or stolen. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your Payment Account (plus your maximum overdraft line of credit). If you tell us within four (4) Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Password, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Password without your permission.
If you do NOT tell us within four (4) Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Password, and we can prove that we could have stopped someone from using your Password without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.
Also, if your statement from your financial institution regarding your Payment Account shows Payments through the Service that you did not authorize, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within ninety (90) days after the statement was sent to you, you may not get back any money transferred through the Service without your authorization after the ninety (90) days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.
If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.
If you believe your Password has been lost or stolen or that someone has transferred or may transfer money through the Service from your Payment Account without your permission, call Time Warner Cable or notify Time Warner Cable in writing, based on the contact information for your local Time Warner Cable office which may be located at <a target="_blank" href="http://twc.com/stores">http://twc.com/stores</a>.

2. Transfer Types and Limitations
You may use the Service to make Payments to Time Warner Cable only.
Monthly recurring Payments to Time Warner Cable authorized through the Service must be for the statement balance due on the Time Warner Cable statement for the particular month. In addition, each Payment made to Time Warner Cable through the Service must be in a minimum dollar amount of $1.00 and cannot exceed $100,000.00.

3. Charges
We will not charge you a fee to make electronic fund transfers through the Service.

4. Confidentiality
We will disclose information to third parties about your Payment Account or the electronic fund transfers you make through the Service only as permitted by our privacy policy set forth at: <a target="_blank" href="http://help.twcable.com/html/policies.html">http://help.twcable.com/html/policies.html</a>.

5. Our Liability
If we do not complete a transfer through the Service from your Payment Account on time or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:
If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your Payment Account to make the transfer or your Payment Account does not otherwise permit the transaction to be executed.
If the transfer would go over the credit limit on your overdraft line.
If the Service was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer.
If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transfer, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.
There may be other exceptions stated in the Master Subscriber Agreement.

6. Errors and Questions
In case of errors or questions about your electronic fund transfers made through the Service, telephone us, write us or chat with  us based on the contact information for your local Time Warner Cable office which may be located at <a target="_blank" href="http://twc.com/stores">http://twc.com/stores</a> as soon as you can, if you think that the statement regarding your Payment Account from your financial institution ("Periodic Statement") is wrong with respect to any Payment made through the Service or if you need more information about a transfer made through the Service that is listed on the Periodic Statement. We must hear from you no later than ninety (90) days after you received the FIRST Periodic Statement on which the problem or error appeared:

(a) Tell us your name and Time Warner Cable account number;
(b) Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information; and
(c) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.

If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within ten (10) Business Days.
We will determine whether an error occurred within ten (10) Business Days after we hear from you and will promptly correct any error. If we need more time, however, we may take up to forty-five (45) days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your Payment Account within ten (10) Business Days after we hear from you for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within ten (10) Business Days, we may not credit your Payment Account. For errors involving new Payment Accounts, we may take up to ninety (90) days to investigate your complaint or question and up to twenty (20) Business Days to credit your Payment Account for the amount you think is in error.
We will tell you the results within three (3) Business Days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.

7. Questions Regarding Transactions Initiated Through the Service
ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSACTIONS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE MUST BE DIRECTED TO US, AND NOT TO THE BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR PAYMENT ACCOUNT. We are responsible for the Service and for resolving any errors in transactions made through the Service.
We will send you monthly bill statements regarding your Time Warner Cable account; however, such monthly bill statements will not list detailed information (such as type of Payment Account or Payment Account number) regarding transactions that you make using the Service. Instead, such details regarding your transfers made through the Service will appear only on the Periodic Statement issued by your bank or other financial institution holding your Payment Account. SAVE YOUR TIME WARNER CABLE BILL STATEMENTS LISTING THE AMOUNT OF ANY PAYMENTS MADE TO TIME WARNER CABLE, AND CHECK THEM AGAINST THE PERIODIC STATEMENT REGARDING YOUR PAYMENT ACCOUNT THAT YOU RECEIVE FROM YOUR BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. If you have any questions about one of these transactions made through the Service, call or write us at the telephone number and address indicated below.
IF YOUR PASSWORD IS LOST OR STOLEN, NOTIFY US AT ONCE by calling or writing to us based on the contact information for your local Time Warner Cable office, which may be located at <a target="_blank" href="http://twc.com/stores">http://twc.com/stores</a>.

    If you are experiencing issues with your phone’s dial tone, please try the following steps:
</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Verify Your Services are working</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you are a TV subscriber, check that your TV is working.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are an Internet subscriber, check that you are able to connect to the Internet.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If all of your services are not working, you may be in an outage. Please <a href="//www.timewarnercable.com/en/support/contact-us.html" class="contact-us" target="_blank">contact us</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:  Verify Connections</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
    If you only have one phone number, the phone cable should be connected from the phone to “Line 1” on the back of the modem, and the coaxial cable should be connected from the cable outlet or splitter to the “Cable In” on the back of the modem.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you have a second phone number, the phone cable should be connected from the phone to “Line 2” on the back of the modem.
    </li>
    <li>
    Verify that cordless phones, if any, are plugged into an electrical outlet.
    </li>
    <li>
    Recheck the phone for a dial tone.  If you have a dial tone, your line is working. If you don’t have a dial tone, please continue.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Try Connecting Another Phone</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Disconnect current phone.
    </li>
    <li>
    Connect the other phone.
    </li>
    <li>
    Recheck the dial tone.
    </li>
    <li>
    If a dial tone is established, your original handset or phone was faulty.
    </li>
    <li>
    If a dial tone is not established, please continue.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Verify Wall Jack</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Disconnect the cable from the modem to the telephone wall jack.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reconnect the phone and modem to another telephone wall jack available in your home.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a dial tone is not established, please <a href="//www.timewarnercable.com/en/support/contact-us.html" class="contact-us" target="_blank">contact us</a> to repair the faulty telephone wall jack.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a dial tone is not reestablished, please continue.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5: Power Off Modem</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Unplug power cord from the back of the modem or directly from the electrical outlet.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the power light is still on, you have a battery backup, and will need either remove the battery or use the reset button to power off the modem.
    </li>
    <li>
        Wait 5 minutes and then plug it back in.
    </li>
    <li>
        It can take up to 10 minutes for the modem to reset, verify a dial tone has been restored.
    </li>
    <li>
        If dial tone is not reestablished <a href="//www.timewarnercable.com/en/support/contact-us.html" class="contact-us" target="_blank">contact us</a>.

    Most set-top box issues can be resolved by manually rebooting. Simply follow the step-by-step instructions below:
</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:  Verify Connections </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Confirm that all cables are correctly connected.
    </li>
    <li>
    Confirm that the colors on the cables match their connections. If you are using a set-top box, DVR, or digital adapter, then the cable coming from the wall should be connected to the "IN" jack on the box.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you're not using a set-top box, DVR or digital adapter, then the cable coming from the wall should be connected to the "IN" jack on the VCR, DVD player, or directly to the TV.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:  Check the TV</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Are the TV and set-top box on?
    </li>
    <li>
    Is the proper Channel selected? (e.g., Channel 3 or Channel 4)
    </li>
    <li>
    Is the proper Input selected? (e.g., Input 1, Component, HDMI, DVI, etc.)
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reboot the Set-Top Box </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Turn off the set-top box by either using your remote control or by pressing the POWER button on the box.
    </li>
    <li>
    Carefully unplug the set-top box power cord from the electrical outlet or power strip if you're using one.
    </li>
    <li>
    Wait 30 seconds while the set-top box completely shuts off.
    </li>
    <li>
    Plug the power cord back in. The set-to box will automatically reboot - this may take a few minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
    Wait for the time or channel to appear on the front of the box.
    </li>
    <li>
    Turn the TV on.
    </li>
</ul>

        <p>Most modem issues can be resolved by manually rebooting. Simply follow the step-by-step instructions below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Verify Connections</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
Check for loose connections. Verify that one end of the coaxial cable is securely connected to the wall outlet and the other end is securely connected to the modem.
    </li>
    <li>
Make sure the power cord is securely connected.
    </li>
    <li>
Check that one end of the Ethernet cable is securely connected to the modem's Ethernet port. Check that the other end is securely connected to the computer's Ethernet port.
    </li>
    <li>
If using a router, securely connect the Ethernet cable to the router's Internet, WAN or modem port.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reboot the Modem and Router (if any)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
    At this point you're ready to reset the modem. You may do so by pressing the reset button on the modem. If the modem does not have a reset button, you may reset it by unplugging the power cable from the modem (and your router if you are using one).
    </li>
    <li>
    Wait approximately 1 minute for the modem to reset.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you have unplugged the power cable from the modem or router, plug your modem back in first, and then your router. If you are using a router, allow about 2 minutes for the router to "sync" (i.e., reconnect) with the modem.
    </li>
    <li>
    Wait for lights to stop blinking on the modem and wireless router if you have one. Allow up to two minutes for the router to “sync” with the modem.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you are connecting via wireless, make sure you’re within range of your wireless router, and that the wireless connection on your computer is turned ON.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Restart Your Computer</strong>
</p><ul>
    <li>
        Restart your computer
    </li>
    <li>
        Open an Internet browser.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test your Internet connection by going to at least two web sites.

    If you are experiencing issues with your phone’s dial tone, please try the following steps:
</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Verify Your Services are working</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you are a TV subscriber, check that your TV is working.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are an Internet subscriber, check that you are able to connect to the Internet.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If all of your services are not working, you may be in an outage. Please <a href="//www.timewarnercable.com/en/support/contact-us.html" class="contact-us" target="_blank">contact us</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:  Verify Connections</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
    If you only have one phone number, the phone cable should be connected from the phone to “Line 1” on the back of the modem, and the coaxial cable should be connected from the cable outlet or splitter to the “Cable In” on the back of the modem.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you have a second phone number, the phone cable should be connected from the phone to “Line 2” on the back of the modem.
    </li>
    <li>
    Verify that cordless phones, if any, are plugged into an electrical outlet.
    </li>
    <li>
    Recheck the phone for a dial tone.  If you have a dial tone, your line is working. If you don’t have a dial tone, please continue.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Try Connecting Another Phone</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Disconnect current phone.
    </li>
    <li>
    Connect the other phone.
    </li>
    <li>
    Recheck the dial tone.
    </li>
    <li>
    If a dial tone is established, your original handset or phone was faulty.
    </li>
    <li>
    If a dial tone is not established, please continue.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Verify Wall Jack</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Disconnect the cable from the modem to the telephone wall jack.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reconnect the phone and modem to another telephone wall jack available in your home.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a dial tone is not established, please <a href="//www.timewarnercable.com/en/support/contact-us.html" class="contact-us" target="_blank">contact us</a> to repair the faulty telephone wall jack.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a dial tone is not reestablished, please continue.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5: Power Off Modem</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Unplug power cord from the back of the modem or directly from the electrical outlet.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the power light is still on, you have a battery backup, and will need either remove the battery or use the reset button to power off the modem.
    </li>
    <li>
        Wait 5 minutes and then plug it back in.
    </li>
    <li>
        It can take up to 10 minutes for the modem to reset, verify a dial tone has been restored.
    </li>
    <li>
        If dial tone is not reestablished <a href="//www.timewarnercable.com/en/support/contact-us.html" class="contact-us" target="_blank">contact us</a>.
